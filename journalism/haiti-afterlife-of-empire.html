<article class="article">

<p>What does colonialism look like once it has learned to disappear?</p>

<p>Not the version preserved in textbooks, with shaded maps and heroic dates. Not the one that announces itself with flags, governors, and proclamations. But the version that survives quietly, through signatures and schedules, through offices far from the places it reshapes.</p>

<p>The kind that no longer needs to raise its voice.</p>

<p>Colonialism did not collapse under the weight of its own violence. It adjusted. It moved indoors. It traded the open brutality of the plantation for the slow precision of paperwork. It learned the language of legality and development. It learned how to wait. It learned how to charge interest.</p>

<p>There is a story often told in the West, usually with sincerity, sometimes with relief. In this version, colonialism ended. Slavery was abolished. Empires withdrew. Nations emerged. The past is acknowledged briefly, before being placed at a safe distance.</p>

<p>The implication is that history has been settled.</p>

<p>Haiti suggests otherwise.</p>

<h2>The plantation that fed Europe</h2>

<p>Before it was Haiti, it was Saint-Domingue. The name travelled well. It appeared in shipping records, insurance ledgers, and merchant correspondence. It was spoken approvingly in European ports and financial houses.</p>

<p>This was not a marginal colony. It was the engine.</p>

<p>By the late eighteenth century, Saint-Domingue supplied much of Europe’s sugar and coffee. Wealth moved quickly and efficiently from the island to the metropole. Those who profited rarely saw the place itself. They saw figures, consignments, returns.</p>

<p>The system was calibrated for maximum output. Enslaved Africans were worked until they collapsed. New shipments arrived to replace them. Death was expected. It was accounted for.</p>

<p>This was modernity, functioning as designed.</p>

<h2>A rupture the system could not absorb</h2>

<p>The enslaved revolted — and won.</p>

<p>In 1804, Haiti declared independence. Recognition did not follow. Isolation did.</p>

<p>In 1825, French warships returned — not with chains, but with terms.</p>

<p>Haiti was asked to pay for the loss of its former masters’ “property.” The property was human beings.</p>

<p>Unable to pay, Haiti borrowed. Freedom arrived on credit.</p>

<h2>The long shadow of repayment</h2>

<p>The debt lingered for over a century. It shaped budgets, starved infrastructure, hollowed institutions.</p>

<p>The final payment was made in 1947.</p>

<p>The transfer was legal. The consequences were permanent.</p>

<h2>After the empire leaves</h2>

<p>Empire did not vanish. It evolved.</p>

<p>Debt replaced chains. Contracts replaced violence. Colonialism became administrative.</p>

<p>Haiti is now described as a failure, as though history simply happened to it.</p>

<h2>What lingers</h2>

<p>The paperwork is closed. The effects remain.</p>

<p>History does not demand repayment.</p>

<p>But it does not forget.</p>
