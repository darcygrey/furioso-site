  <article class="article">
    <p>There is a lie we like to tell ourselves in the West. It is a comforting lie, dressed in the language of progress, legality, and time.</p>

    <p>The lie goes something like this: colonialism ended. Slavery was abolished. Empires retreated. Flags were lowered. Nations were born. The past, however regrettable, is finished business.</p>

    <p>But history doesn’t end. It compounds.</p>

    <p>If colonialism truly ended, Haiti would not look the way it does today.</p>

    <h2>The first crime: slavery as an industry</h2>

    <p>Haiti — once Saint-Domingue — was not just a colony. It was the colony.</p>

    <p>By the late 18th century, it was the most profitable plantation economy on Earth. Sugar, coffee, indigo. Wealth poured into France at a pace that made European aristocrats salivate. That wealth was wrung from enslaved Africans worked to death and replaced as consumables.</p>

    <p>This was not medieval bondage. This was industrialised slavery — racial, hereditary, mechanised, and legal. Human beings as capital assets. Death built into the business model.</p>

    <p>France grew rich. Haiti bled.</p>

    <h2>The second crime: freedom with a receipt</h2>

    <p>Then something unprecedented happened.</p>

    <p>The enslaved revolted — and won.</p>

    <p>In 1804, Haiti became the first Black republic in the modern world and the only nation ever founded by a successful slave uprising. It shattered the moral architecture of empire. And empires do not forgive humiliation.</p>

    <p>In 1825, France returned — not with chains, but with warships.</p>

    <p>The terms were simple: Haiti could be recognised as a sovereign nation if it paid France 150 million francs to compensate former slave owners for their “lost property.” That property was human beings.</p>

    <p>Unable to pay, Haiti borrowed — from French banks — at punishing interest.</p>

    <p>Freedom was granted on credit.</p>

    <p>This was not restitution. It was extortion dressed as diplomacy.</p>

    <h2>The third crime: debt as discipline</h2>

    <p>What followed was not a single payment, but a century-long financial chokehold.</p>

    <p>Haiti refinanced, rolled interest into new loans, paid commissions and penalties, and exported its national income to Parisian banking houses. The debt was not fully discharged until 1947 — within living memory.</p>

    <p>Schools went unbuilt. Roads remained dirt. Institutions never matured. Wealth that should have compounded inward flowed outward instead.</p>

    <p>By conservative estimates, Haiti transferred the equivalent of tens of billions of dollars in today’s value — not through theft, but through contracts.</p>

    <p>Colonialism had learned paperwork.</p>

    <h2>The West adapts</h2>

    <p>France was not alone.</p>

    <p>In the early 20th century, the United States occupied Haiti, seized its customs revenues, and handed financial control to American banks. National City Bank of New York — now Citibank — took its turn at the tap.</p>

    <p>This was not slavery. It was not even formal colonialism.</p>

    <p>It was geopolitics.</p>

    <p>And geopolitics, when asymmetric and sustained, produces colonial outcomes whether it admits to them or not.</p>

    <h2>Colonialism doesn’t vanish — it mutates</h2>

    <p>By the mid-20th century, the West congratulated itself. Slavery abolished. Empires dissolved. The moral arc bent, supposedly, toward justice.</p>

    <p>But what replaced empire was not equality — it was dependency.</p>

    <p>Debt. Trade rules. Extractive markets. Weak states inheriting borders designed to fracture them. Institutions hollowed out before they could stand.</p>

    <p>Colonialism no longer needed governors. It needed spreadsheets.</p>

    <p>Today, Haiti is described as a “failed state,” as though failure emerged spontaneously — as though history simply happened to it.</p>

    <p>This is the final insult: erasing causality.</p>

    <h2>The uncomfortable question</h2>

    <p>France no longer collects payments. The United States no longer occupies Port-au-Prince. The contracts are closed.</p>

    <p>But the effects remain.</p>

    <p>Haiti did not simply fall behind — it was held back, systematically, for over a century. While Western nations compounded wealth, Haiti serviced debt imposed for the crime of self-liberation.</p>

    <p>So the question is not legal. International law protects the past. Banks merge. States disclaim continuity.</p>

    <p>The question is moral.</p>

    <p>If wealth extracted under coercion helped build modern France, modern banks, modern power — does responsibility evaporate with time?</p>

    <p>If colonialism has merely changed form, does justice require more than acknowledgements and aid packages?</p>

    <p>And if the answer is no — if nothing is owed — then what exactly does the West believe responsibility means?</p>

    <p>Haiti paid for its freedom.</p>

    <p>The bill was never returned.</p>

    <p>The interest, it seems, is still accruing.</p>

    <p>History does not ask to be repaid. But it does demand to be recognised.</p>

    <p>And recognition, sooner or later, always comes due.</p>
